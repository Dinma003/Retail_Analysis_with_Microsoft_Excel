2. **Revise Strategies for Low-Performing Products:** Products with lower sales or higher COGS should be evaluated for potential improvements or repositioning to enhance their market performance.
3. **Expand in High-Growth Markets:** Regions showing strong sales growth should be targeted for further expansion, possibly through tailored marketing campaigns or localized product offerings.
4. **Monitor Cost Trends Closely:** Regular monitoring of manufacturing costs and COGS is recommended to ensure that cost-efficiency improvements are sustained and that pricing strategies remain competitive.
