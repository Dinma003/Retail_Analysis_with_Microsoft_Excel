## Recommendations

Based on the data presented in the dashboard, here are some recommendations:

1. **Focus on High-Performing Segments:** The segments contributing the most to total profit should be further leveraged through increased marketing and product development efforts.
2. **Optimize Low-Performing Products:** Products with low sales or high COGS should be reviewed to determine if improvements can be made, whether through cost reduction, quality enhancement, or repositioning.
3. **Expand in High-Revenue Countries:** Countries with high revenue should be targeted for expansion, possibly by introducing new products or increasing market penetration strategies.
4. **Monitor Cost Trends:** Regularly monitor the trend of manufacturing costs to ensure that pricing strategies remain competitive without sacrificing profitability.
